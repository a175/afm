AFM - pdf2sty

AFM is a GUI python program to help to create LaTeX style files from PDF files.

From given pdf file, e.g., sample/sample-form, we can create a LaTeX style file, e.g., sample/sample-form-stylefile.zip, by using this program.
The style file is not so user-friendly.  But we may modify it directly (rename the commands, add some user frontend commands, and so on), e.g., sample/sample-form-stylefile-modified.zip.
