AFM - pdf2sty

AFM is a small GUI python program
to help to create a LaTeX style file from a PDF file.

From given pdf file, e.g.,
[sample/sample-form.pdf](https://github.com/a175/afm/blob/master/sample/sample-form.pdf),
we can create a LaTeX style file, e.g.,
[sample/sample-form-stylefile.zip](https://github.com/a175/afm/blob/master/sample/sample-form-stylefile.zip),
by using this program.
Commands in the style file is not so user-friendly.
But we may modify it directly (rename the commands, add some user frontend commands, and so on), e.g.,
[sample/sample-form-stylefile-modified.zip](https://github.com/a175/afm/blob/master/sample/sample-form-stylefile-modified.zip).
